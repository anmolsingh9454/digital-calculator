AI Calculator

A small static calculator app with all buttons wired and a local "AI" natural-language parser that converts simple English math queries into expressions. No external APIs.

How to run

Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or open from VS Code Live Server).

Usage

- Use the buttons or keyboard to build expressions.
- Type natural language in the AI input, for example:
  - "what is 5 times 12"
  - "sqrt of 16 + 3"
  - "12 divided by 4"

Notes

This is a local, naive natural-language parser and supports basic phrases and numbers up to twenty as words. It's intended as a demo and not a production AI service.
